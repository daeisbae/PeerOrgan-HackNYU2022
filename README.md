# Description
## 💡 Inspiration 💡
Even with advancements in storage technology, organs can survive outside of the body for only 4-24hours, thousands of organs that could be **SAVING LIVES** are wasted! According to Bloomworks digital, it's estimated that 28 000 usable donated organs are disposed of every year. 🥺 By connecting donors with recipients, Peer Organ hopes to change that!

## ⚙️ What it does ⚙️
You can sign up on the app as a donor or recipient and connect with each other directly and get tailored donor results based on your health background (ie. blood type, drug use, alcohol use, etc) and location. 

## 🛠️ How we built it 🛠️
For the frontend, we used **React (JS)** and **Framer-motion** in combination with **Ant-design** to create a visually pleasing and accessible way for users to communicate.

To store user data, we took advantage of **SQL**, **django** and **orm** because of its ease of access to set up and access data. 

For the recommendation feature, we used **Pandas**, **Numpy** and **Seaborn** to preprocess our data. We trained our model using **Sklearn** on 800 different organ donors.   

## 😣 Challenges we ran into 😣
We were plagued with challenges throughout NYUHacks because of our conflicting schedules, different time zones, and time management. 

Some Challenges include:
- Getting reactJS to work on everyone's computer 
- Organizing schedules
- Finding a good dataset for organ donations
- Properly implementing user authentication 
- Getting multiplier reactJS pages to work together seamlessly

## 🎉 Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉
We accomplished A LOT during the past 48 hours!

Some notable accomplishments include:
- Managed to work under tight time constraints (We started working with only 28 hours left 💀)
- Figuring out how to connect SQL/Django/orm together to authenticate users and grab data from the SQL database
- Designing the app from scratch (Shoutout to Fei, AMAZING UI/UX designer 🤗)
- Using so many tools, languages and frameworks at once, and making them work together :D

## ⏭️What's next for Peer Organ⏭️
- Implement a chat feature so users can talk amongst themselves from recipients to donors
- Enhance our recommendation feature (add more search terms)
- Possibly add another user flow for medical professionals
- Connect with local hospitals/healthcare professionals to provide user data to
- Add donation features so that users can thank one another for their organs and/or support recipients financially (we know how much healthcare costs in the US...  A LOT )
